# California Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for California housing prices using advanced machine learning techniques. The dataset incorporates key housing attributes, such as median income, population, and geographical characteristics, to estimate property values with high accuracy.

## Dataset
The **California Housing Dataset** is utilized for this study, comprising the following features:
- **Longitude & Latitude** - Geographic coordinates of the property
- **Median Income** - Median income of residents in the area
- **Housing Median Age** - Age of the property
- **Total Rooms & Bedrooms** - Number of rooms and bedrooms per household
- **Population & Households** - Total population and number of households in a block
- **Median House Value** - Target variable representing house prices

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (Model training, Grid Search optimization)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Data scaling and encoding
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying trends and patterns in housing prices
   - Correlation analysis between features
   
3. **Model Development & Training**
   - Implementing and comparing models such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and other machine learning algorithms
   - Addressing underfitting and overfitting challenges
   - Fine-tuning models using **Grid Search**
   
4. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Assessing models using key metrics: **RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score**
   - Identifying the best-performing model: **[Specify best model]**
   - Achieved accuracy: **[Specify accuracy]**

## Installation & Execution
